1. Identify how to distribute the reward tokens. You can't offer a fixed rate of rewards.

You must calculate it based on the amount of tokens of token holders that are in the moment and the fixed supply of token rewards to be offeret accross the years.

1200 M tokens / 8 years
150 M tokens / year
12.5 M tokens / month

totalStakingReward = tokensForMonthlyRewards * (numberOfMyStakedTokens/totalNumberOfTokens) * (duration/30)


2. Continue to test in localhost the depositStaking() function

3. Continue developing and test the claimStakingRewards() function

along with the calculateStakingRewards() there is an issue there around the proportionOfTokenRewardsPerMonth

it seems like when you dont make more than 100% of staked tokens you get 0% of the rewards

The contract function "claimStakingRewards" reverted with the following reason:
Division or modulo by zero (e.g. `5 / 0` or `23 % 0`).
Panic(18)

4. There is a problem with the percentage of rewardRatePerMonth and how to updated

10.000.000
RATE 0.00142045
RATE 0.142045 %

14.204 REWARDS

14204545 = 0.00142045
1000000000 = 0.1

500000000 = 5%
1000000000 = 10%

StakerData name of struct DONE
lastStakedTimestamp name DONE
totalSupply for rewards DONE
Add total staked tokens variable DONE
Add notifyRewardAmount recieving only the investor address DONE
Decrease the total staked tokens variable when unstaking DONE
Decrease the reward tokens variable when claimstaking DONE
Add the events DONE
Clean the code DONE
Add penalty fees to the rewards that way they can get redistributed and if necessary the owner can take them back DONE



TECHNICAL OPTIONS
Change the code so that if the investor does two stakings the rewards are sent to him in case already passed more than 1 month doing the previous staking
Calculate the reward and send it in the same unstake function? https://medium.com/@solidity101/day-93-100-defi-discrete-staking-rewards-a9c0686aa079
Add function to tell the moment when you will recieve your rewards so you can unstake or compound?

BUSINESS OPTIONS
IMPORTANT: In the current set up the smart contract will trap the penalty tokens for early unstaking. And let in a LIMBO in the variable totalStakedTokens

If the duration of staking is <30 days there are no rewards to offer?
-unstake <30 no rewards GOOD
-unstake <30 5% penalty over the total staked amount + rewards MEDIUM
-unstake <30 no rewards + 5% penalty over the total staked amount EVIL

-Is there any minimum staking amount?
-Add compound function to investors?
-Give the rewards based on supply and demand instead of fixed rate?

IMBALANCE OF 84,691,328.81 @ 0.006 = 508,148 K

-----SOLVED-----

1. Just stake for all 8 years: 8,726,000,000 
Guarantee not stake: 74,000,000

2. Stop giving stake after 7.5 years

3. Modify rates at the end depending on the stake at the moment

4. Modify the rate in the beginig to %1.598981 so it can absorb the compounders
